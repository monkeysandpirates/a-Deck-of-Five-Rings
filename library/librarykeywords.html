<li data-role="list-divider"></span> Ancestral</li>
<li data-filtertext="Ancestral">Ancestral is a keyword ability that appears on attachments. If the card or game element to which an ancestral attachment is attached leaves play, the ancestral attachment is returned to its owner’s hand instead of being discarded.</li>

<li data-role="list-divider"></span> Courtesy</li>
<li data-filtertext="Courtesy">Courtesy is a keyword ability. When a card with the courtesy keyword leaves play, its controller gains 1 fate</li>

<li data-role="list-divider"></span> Covert</li>
<li data-filtertext="Covert">Covert is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a conflict, for each character with the covert keyword he or she declares as an attacker, that player may choose one character without covert controlled by the defending player. Each chosen character is considered evaded by covert, and cannot be declared as a defender for that conflict.
<br>Card abilities may be used to move characters that have been evaded by covert into a conflict as defenders.
<br>Covert may only be used when characters are declared as attackers. If a character with covert is moved into or played into a conflict after the point at which the conflict was declared, that character’s covert ability does not resolve.</li>

<li data-role="list-divider"></span> Limited</li>
<li data-filtertext="Limited">Limited is a keyword ability. No more than one card in total with the limited keyword can be played by each player each round.
<br>Cards played from hand and played from a player’s provinces are restricted by and count toward this limit.
<br>Limited cards that are "put into play" via card abilities ignore and are ignored by this restriction.</li>

<li data-role="list-divider"></span> No attachments</li>
<li data-filtertext="No attachments">No attachments is a keyword ability. A card with this keyword cannot have an attachment card attached.
<br>If one or more traits precedes the word “attachments” (for example, "No Weapon or Armor attachments"), the card cannot have an attachment that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it can have attachments possessing none of those traits.
<br>If the word "attachments" is followed by the word “except” and one or more traits (for example, "No attachments except Weapon"), the card can have attachments that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it cannot have attachments possessing none of those traits.
<br>If a card has multiple variants of the “No attachments” keyword, any variant that would prevent a card from having a given attachment prevails.</li>

<li data-role="list-divider"></span> Pride</li>
<li data-filtertext="Pride">Pride is a keyword ability. After a character with the pride keyword wins a conflict, honor that character. After a character with the pride keyword loses a conflict, dishonor that character.</li>

<li data-role="list-divider"></span> Restricted</li>
<li data-filtertext="Restricted">Restricted is a keyword ability. A character may not have more than two attachments with the restricted keyword attached to it at any time.
<br>If at any time a character has three or more restricted attachments, that character’s controller must immediately choose and discard one of the restricted attachments on the character as soon as the illegal game state occurs.</li>

<li data-role="list-divider"></span> Sincerity</li>
