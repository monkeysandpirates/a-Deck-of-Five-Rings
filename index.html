A Disguised character can be played normally, during the appropriate Action windows.<br>- If the non-unique character is participating in a conflict, the Disguised character may enter play in the conflict or at home.<br>- If the non-unique character is at home, the Disguised character must enter play at home.<br>- Only the physical components (Fate, Status token, attachments) get moved to the Disguised character after it enters play. Lasting effects (eg. skill bonuses such as Banzai! or Supernatural Storm) are not transferred to the Disguised character.<br>- With the Disguised keyword, you can only play the character during the conflict phase. (You can play them normally during the timing windows appropriate for that card.)<br>- Reactions to a Disguised character being played wait for the entire process to complete.<br>- All attachments move to the Disguised character, and are then checked to see if they are legally attached.<br>- All attachments move simultaneously. Therefore, if one attachment relies on a trait provided by a second attachment (eg. Iaijutsu Master and Seal of the Crane), both attachments will remain attached.Hiruma Yoshino cannot choose a character with a zero or dash military skill.<p>If the character chosen by Hiruma Yoshino leaves the province and enters play (eg. Charge!), the discard pile (eg. Sabotage), or the dynasty deck (eg. Peasant's Advice), the lasting effect expires, and the character no longer contributes its skill.<p>If the character chosen by Hiruma Yoshino is moved from its current province to another of your provinces (eg. Asahina Takako), it will continue to contribute its military skill.<p>During a conflict at Sanpuku Seido, the character chosen by Hiruma Yoshino will count its printed glory instead of its military skill.<p>If the conflict type is switched to political (eg. Kuroi Mori), the chosen character will still count its printed military skill.<p>The character chosen by Hiruma Yoshino is not participating in the conflict, it is contributing its skill.<br>A player must count at least 1 total skill and there must be at least one participating character on his or her side in order to win a conflict.</span></li>

Therefore, during the payment of the Test of Skill’s cost, it is still on top of your deck and will be revealed as part of the cost of playing the event.<br>While it is already revealed by the Academy or Pillow Book, it can still be revealed again to satisfy its own cost. However, once it leaves the top of your deck (after paying costs and choosing targets in step 5—see "Initiating Abilities"), it no longer becomes "one of the revealed cards" and cannot be put back into your hand.

Relevant for cards like Shiotome Encampment.<p>When you play Know the World, you take a ring from the unclaimed ring pool and place it in your claimed ring pool same side up as the ring that you are returning.<br>Example: During a military conflict you claim the Air ring, and place it in your claimed ring pool military side up.

Losing honor for unopposed and breaking the province will occur before resolving Display of Power’s effect.<br>- Should Pilgrimage not be broken when Display of Power resolves, the delayed effect of Display takes precedence over Pilgrimage, canceling the normal resolution of "Resolve Ring Effects" and replacing it with the adjusted means of resolution. However, the Pilgrimage effect ("cancel all ring effects") still cancels the Display of Power’s attempt to resolve the ring for the defender. The defender claims the ring.<br>- Because Display of Power interacts with the "Resolve Ring Effects" step rather than the specific effect chosen by the attacker, the attacker does not have the option to choose a specific ring effect to resolve when Seeker of Knowledge is attacking (or whether they would like to resolve a ring effect at all). When Display of Power resolves the ring effect, the defender has the opportunity to choose which ring effect they would like to resolve instead, and may choose to not resolve the ring’s effect if they desire.<p>Resolving ring effects *as the attacking player* is optional. You may choose not to resolve the ring effect, and just claim the ring.<p>If a player plays Display of Power after Isawa Kaede wins the conflict as an attacker, that player gets to resolve all of the contested ring's effects.<p>Display of Power cannot be played by the attacking player.<br>A conflict is unopposed if the attacking player wins the conflict and the defending player controls no participating characters at the time the conflict winner is determined.<br>"That ring effect" and "that ring" refer to the ring effect that was cancelled (and its associated ring). Therefore, if no ring effect was cancelled, then the ability can do nothing more.<p>Once the normal ring effect for the conflict has been cancelled by Display of Power, you cannot play a second Display of Power as it would have nothing to cancel.</span></li>

<li data-role="list-divider" data-link="Keywords" class="fontbrush">Keywords</li>
<li class="lazy hidden Keywords"><a></a><p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Ancestral</b></span> is a keyword ability that appears on attachments. If the card or game element to which an ancestral attachment is attached leaves play, the ancestral attachment is returned to its owner's hand instead of being discarded.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Composure</b></span>  is a variable keyword ability. A card with this keyword gains an additional ability while its controller’s honor bid is lower than that of one of his or her opponents.<br>Most uses of the composure keyword grant a constant ability that modifies a character’s skills or glory. Some may grant triggered abilities that can only be used while a player has composure.
<br>"You have composure" is the phrase indicating that a player’s composure keyword is active. It is used in reminder text to indicate that a player’s card has the ability granted by composure while their honor bid is lower than an opponent’s.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Courtesy</b></span> is a keyword ability. When a card with the courtesy keyword leaves play, its controller gains 1 fate.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Covert</b></span> is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a conflict, for each character with the covert keyword he or she declares as an attacker, that player may choose one character without covert controlled by the defending player. Each chosen character is considered evaded by covert, and cannot be declared as a defender for that conflict.
<br>Card abilities may be used to move Characters that have been evaded by covert into a conflict as defenders.
<br>Covert may only be used when Characters are declared as attackers. If a character with covert is moved into or played into a conflict after the point at which the conflict was declared, that character's covert ability does not resolve.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Disguised</b></span> is a keyword ability which appears on unique characters. When a character is played using the disguised keyword, it replaces a non-unique character of the correct Trait or clan affiliation, inheriting all of that character’s attachments, fate, and status tokens. This is an alternate means by which to play a character and carries a number of unique rules including, but not limited to, an additional cost of choosing and discarding a non-unique character.
<br>When playing a character using the disguised keyword, you may play that character during the conflict phase, following all timing rules which apply to playing characters from hand.
<br>To play a character using the disguised keyword, you must choose a non-unique character you control of the appropriate Trait or clan affiliation as an additional cost to play the character. Reduce the cost to play the disguised character by the printed cost of the chosen character, play the disguised character, then move all attachments and tokens (fate, status, etc.) from the chosen character to the disguised character. Finally, discard the chosen character from play. Interrupts cannot be used to replace or prevent this discard.<br>A character played using the disguised keyword cannot be played into a conflict unless the character chosen by the keyword was also participating in the conflict, and fate from your fate pool cannot be put on it.
<br>A character played using this keyword enters play ready.  
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Limited</b></span> is a keyword ability. No more than one card in total with the limited keyword can be played by each player each round.
<br>Cards played from hand and played from a player's provinces are restricted by and count toward this limit.
<br>Limited cards that are "put into play" via card abilities ignore and are ignored by this restriction.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>No attachments</b></span> is a keyword ability. A card with this keyword cannot have an attachment card attached.
<br>If one or more traits precedes the word "attachments" (for example, "No Weapon or Armor attachments"), the card cannot have an attachment that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it can have attachments possessing none of those traits.
<br>If the word "attachments" is followed by the word "except" and one or more traits (for example, "No attachments except Weapon"), the card can have attachments that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it cannot have attachments possessing none of those traits.
<br>If a card has multiple variants of the "No attachments" keyword, any variant that would prevent a card from having a given attachment prevails.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Pride</b></span> is a keyword ability. After a character with the pride keyword wins a conflict, honor that character. After a character with the pride keyword loses a conflict, dishonor that character.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Restricted</b></span> is a keyword ability. A character may not have more than two attachments with the restricted keyword attached to it at any time.
<br>If at any time a character has three or more restricted attachments, that character's controller must immediately choose and discard one of the restricted attachments on the character as soon as the illegal game state occurs.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Sincerity</b></span> is a keyword ability. When a card with the sincerity keyword leaves play, its controller draws 1 card.</li>
