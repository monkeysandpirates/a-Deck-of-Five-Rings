<li data-role="list-divider" data-link="Keywords" class="fontbrush">Keywords</li>
<li class="lazy hidden Keywords"><a></a><p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Ancestral</b></span> is a keyword ability that appears on attachments. If the card or game element to which an ancestral attachment is attached leaves play, the ancestral attachment is returned to its owner's hand instead of being discarded.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Composure</b></span>  is a variable keyword ability. A card with this keyword gains an additional ability while its controller’s honor bid is lower than that of one of his or her opponents.<br>Most uses of the composure keyword grant a constant ability that modifies a character’s skills or glory. Some may grant triggered abilities that can only be used while a player has composure.
<br>“You have composure” is the phrase indicating that a player’s composure keyword is active. It is used in reminder text to indicate that a player’s card has the ability granted by composure while their honor bid is lower than an opponent’s.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Courtesy</b></span> is a keyword ability. When a card with the courtesy keyword leaves play, its controller gains 1 fate.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Covert</b></span> is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a conflict, for each character with the covert keyword he or she declares as an attacker, that player may choose one character without covert controlled by the defending player. Each chosen character is considered evaded by covert, and cannot be declared as a defender for that conflict.
<br>Card abilities may be used to move Characters that have been evaded by covert into a conflict as defenders.
<br>Covert may only be used when Characters are declared as attackers. If a character with covert is moved into or played into a conflict after the point at which the conflict was declared, that character's covert ability does not resolve.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Disguised</b></span> is a keyword ability. These samurai bear the new disguised keyword, followed by a trait or clan affiliation—for example "Bushi". These disguised characters can be played normally, but they also have a unique way of entering the battlefield from your provinces or from your hand.
<br>If you choose to, you can unveil your disgusied character by choosing any non-unique character that matches the restrictions listed on the disguised character. You'll reduce the cost to play the disguised character from your province or your hand by the printed cost of the chosen character, and when you play the disguised character, you'll move all attachments and tokens (including fate tokens and status tokens) from the chosen character to the disguised character. Finally, you'll discard the chosen character from play—they have revealed themselves to be the disguised samurai!
<br>Importantly, your disguised samurai can't have additional fate put on them when they're played in this way!
<br>Even if they are a dynasty card you can use the disguised keyword any time you could play a character from your hand during the conflict phase, and they will always enter the field unbowed.  
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Limited</b></span> is a keyword ability. No more than one card in total with the limited keyword can be played by each player each round.
<br>Cards played from hand and played from a player's provinces are restricted by and count toward this limit.
<br>Limited cards that are "put into play" via card abilities ignore and are ignored by this restriction.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>No attachments</b></span> is a keyword ability. A card with this keyword cannot have an attachment card attached.
<br>If one or more traits precedes the word “attachments” (for example, "No Weapon or Armor attachments"), the card cannot have an attachment that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it can have attachments possessing none of those traits.
<br>If the word "attachments" is followed by the word “except” and one or more traits (for example, "No attachments except Weapon"), the card can have attachments that possess one or more of the specified traits, but it cannot have attachments possessing none of those traits.
<br>If a card has multiple variants of the “No attachments” keyword, any variant that would prevent a card from having a given attachment prevails.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Pride</b></span> is a keyword ability. After a character with the pride keyword wins a conflict, honor that character. After a character with the pride keyword loses a conflict, dishonor that character.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Restricted</b></span> is a keyword ability. A character may not have more than two attachments with the restricted keyword attached to it at any time.
<br>If at any time a character has three or more restricted attachments, that character's controller must immediately choose and discard one of the restricted attachments on the character as soon as the illegal game state occurs.
<p><span class="fontbrush"><b>Sincerity</b></span> is a keyword ability. When a card with the sincerity keyword leaves play, its controller draws 1 card.</li>
